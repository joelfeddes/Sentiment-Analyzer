# Sentiment-Analyzer
This program takes in a csv file or typed-up text and determines, from the text, whether the provided text is positively or negatively connotated. You will need the sentiments.txt file to use as the library to provide the program with a "word scale". In this file, each adjective is associated with a specific numeric value.

I supplied a few csv files you could use to test the program.
